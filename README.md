</p>
<p>
STEP 1: Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A.

  
  - Use "mkdir" directory creation tool followed by Internal_Investigation_Employee_A

</p>
<br />

<p>
  
![STEP 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58670f49-a4af-45fd-a6c7-8485c2a0308d)

>
</p>
<p>
STEP 2: Create the following three files inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder:
  
email_evidence
log_evidence
web_evidence

Delete the file called web_evidence, as you have realized Candy has no web logs captured.

- Use "touch" file creation tool within the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A directory followed by web_evidence log_evidence email_evidence

- Use "rm" remove tool to remove web_evidence

</p>
<p>
STEP 3: Create an additional folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_B.

-  - Use "mkdir" directory creation tool followed by Internal_Investigation_Employee_B

  
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
STEP 4: Using absolute paths, move the file email_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to 

Internal_Investigation_Employee_B because you have been told there wonâ€™t be email evidence for the first employee.

- Use "mv" to initiate the migration of "email_evidence over to Employee B

- mv /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_investigate_Employee_A/email_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_investigate_Employee_B/

<p>
STEP 5: Using absolute paths, copy the file log_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to 

Internal_Investigation_Employee_B, as you have been told there will likely be log evidence from both employees.

- Use "cp" to initiate the migration of "email_evidence over to Employee B

- cp /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_investigate_Employee_A/log_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_investigate_Employee_B/
